NW.js + Cypress (WIP)

This is a basic repo to attempt to get Cypress to run inside NW.js.

Currently it does not work, however I'm hoping someone will be able to figure it out and submit a PR. Or find out why it can't be done, so we can get Cypress or NW.js to change whatever is needed on their ends to make it work.
